About.
~~~~~~

This is a very simple gateway allowing to control MT4 terminal(s) by
an external program using Fix protocol. In particular it alows to read
quotes from charts and to execute trading orders. Gateway is able to
serve only one TCP/IP connection at the time. 

This program is distributed as is without any warranty. We have used
it in our project and it mostly worked fine. If you have any problem,
please contact the author.

The gateway keeps some information about orders. The info is
initialized when gateway starts and updated when orders are executed
via gateway.  This info may be desynchronized if you close an order
manually. In such a case it is better to restart MT4.




Installation of binaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use precompiled version of this bridge:

1.) Copy files fixOrderGateway.ex4 and fixQuoteSender.ex4 from directory "experts"
    to your metatrader terminal installation directory "experts". I.e. if your metatrader
    installation directory is something like C:\Program Files\MetaTrader - Alpari UK, then
    copy those files into C:\Program Files\MetaTrader - Alpari UK\experts.

2.) Copy file fixGateway.dll from directory "experts/libraries" to
    your metatrader directory experts/libraries. I.e. for example to
    C:\Program Files\MetaTrader - Alpari UK\experts\libraries.

3.) Restart your metatrader terminal. FixOrderGateway and
    FixQuoteSender shall be listed in your Expert Advisors list.

4.) Drag and drop FixOrderGateway to one chart (say EUR/GBP) and drag
    and drop fixQuoteSender to all charts from where you wants to
    receive quotes. In the dialog which appears, check "Allow live
    trading", "Allow dll import" and uncheck "Confirm dll function
    calls".


It is done. If everything goes well the gateway is running. You can
connect to it on the port 9871.  This is a very simple gateway, you
will need to restart it iften after loosing a conenction or when
something goes wrong.




Compiling from source code.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The dll is compiled using MinGW compiler and Msys environment. To
recompile it from source install MinGW (with Msys), unpack the gateway
distribution into your msys home directory and run make. You may need to
modify Makefile to add/remove metatrader terminal directories.

To recompile EA sources fixOrderGateway.mq4 and fixQuoteSender.mq4 use the
compiler coming with your metatrader terminal.


Customizing the gateway.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize gateway with MT4 global variables.

fixGatewayPort   - is storing the port number where fixGateway listen for connections.

fixGatewayAlerts - if non zero, Alerts will be displayed on each fixGateway action.




Simple check.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can check whether the gateway is running by a simple check.  If
your gateway is running on a computer with IP say 192.168.1.126 and
you have telnet installed, run the command:

  telnet 192.168.1.126 9871

If the gateway is running you shall see quotes coming from the fix
gateway. Note that no other program can be connected to the gateway at
the time of check.

On a Linux box you can use echo to execute an order. For example the command:

((echo -n -e '8=FIX.4.4\00019=149\000135=D\000149=T\000156=ALP\000134=5\000152=20130117-10:48:09.342\00011=0000\000111=41962105\000121=1\000138=1000\000140=1\000147=A\000154=1\000155=EURUSD\000159=1\000160=20130117-10:48:09.342\0001100=MBTX\0001553=M\000110=237\0001'; sleep 5; echo -n -e '8=FIX.4.4\00019=149\000135=D\000149=T\000156=ALP\000134=6\000152=20130117-10:48:15.316\00011=0000\000111=41962106\000121=1\000138=1000\000140=1\000147=A\000154=2\000155=EURUSD\000159=1\000160=20130117-10:48:15.316\0001100=MBTX\0001553=M\000110=236\0001') & sleep 10 ) | telnet 192.168.1.126 9871 | od -c

will buy 1000 EUR/USD, wait 5 seconds and sell it.
